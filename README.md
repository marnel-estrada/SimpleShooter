# SimpleShooter
This is a very simple shooter game made in Godot 3 using C#. This was originally my test project while going through Godot's getting started tutorial. The game is a space shooter where you control a space ship and shoot incoming UFOs. Ship, lasers, increasing enemies, that's it.

To run the game:
* Open the project in Godot 3
* Open Main.tscn found in res://Game/Scenes folder.
* Press the play button or press F5.

There are still missing mechanics like there's no scoring and game over state. I just wanted to share this project for those who are planning to use Godot and see what a basic C# game looks like.
